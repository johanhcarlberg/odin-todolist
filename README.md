# Todo-List
This project is part of the JavaScript course on [The Odin Project website](https://www.theodinproject.com)  
The purpose of the project is to practice using JavaScript by creating a simple TodoList application using localStorage to store data.  
As an exercise later in the course, integration with Firebase was added. Firebase is used to provide Google authentication and database storage for users.
